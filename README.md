# GitHub Runner on AKS

This project demonstrates how to run GitHub self-hosted runners inside containers deployed to an AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service) cluster. The solution builds a Docker image that contains all necessary dependencies, configures the GitHub runner on startup, and manages graceful termination (deregistration) using Kubernetes lifecycle hooks.

## Overview

The project includes the following files:

- **Dockerfile**  
  Builds the Ubuntu-based runner container image. It installs required tools such as Docker CLI, Azure CLI, and Git, creates a non-root user (`runner`), downloads the GitHub runner binaries, and sets up the image entrypoint to the runner startup script.

- **start.sh**  
  The entrypoint script for the Docker container. It:
  - Waits for environment initialization.
  - Starts the Docker daemon.
  - Configures the GitHub runner (using `config.sh`) if it hasn’t been configured already.
  - Sets a cleanup trap to deregister the runner when the container receives a termination signal.
  - Finally, starts the GitHub runner process (`run.sh`).

- **k8s-runner-deployment.yaml**  
  A Kubernetes deployment manifest that creates two replicas of the GitHub runner pod. It sets environment variables (such as organization, repository, and access token) and uses a pre-stop lifecycle hook to deregister the runner gracefully using the `config.sh remove` command.

- **github-runner-token.yaml**  
  A Kubernetes Secret manifest that stores the GitHub repository or organization runner token. The token is base64 encoded and injected into the runner pod as an environment variable.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying this solution, ensure you have:

- An AKS cluster up and running.
- The CLI tools installed:
  - Docker
  - kubectl configured for your AKS cluster
  - Azure CLI (if needed for managing AKS and other Azure resources)
- A DockerHub account for pushing the container image (or any other container registry of your choice).
- A GitHub token for registering the runner, already encoded in base64 for use in the Kubernetes secret.

## Setup and Deployment

### 1. Build and Push the Docker Image

Update the **Dockerfile** if necessary (for example, to change the runner version or adjust dependencies). Then build and push the image to your DockerHub repository.

```bash
# Build the Docker image (replace <your-dockerhub-username> and <image-name> accordingly)
docker build -t <your-dockerhub-username>/<image-name>:latest .

# Log in to DockerHub if required
docker login

# Push the image to DockerHub
docker push <your-dockerhub-username>/<image-name>:latest
```

> **Note:** In this example, the Kubernetes deployment (k8s-runner-deployment.yaml) uses the image `msftcontainers/github-runner:latest`. If you are pushing your own image, update the `image` field in the YAML file accordingly.

### 2. Create the Kubernetes Namespace and Secret

Create a dedicated namespace for your GitHub runners. Then deploy the secret containing your GitHub runner access token.

```bash
# Create the namespace (if it does not exist)
kubectl create namespace github-runners

# Apply the GitHub runner token secret
kubectl apply -f github-runner-token.yaml
```

Ensure that the token in **github-runner-token.yaml** is base64 encoded. For example, if your token is `AE2IWNA46O6464ZFVJWJBA3HZJIVM`, run:

```bash
echo -n "AE2IWNA46O6464ZFVJWJBA3HZJIVM" | base64
```

and update the YAML file with the output.

### 3. Deploy the GitHub Runner Deployment

Apply the deployment manifest to your AKS cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s-runner-deployment.yaml
```

This creates the runner pods in the `github-runners` namespace. Each pod will run the GitHub runner container, configure itself using the provided environment variables, and register with the specified GitHub repository or organization.

### 4. Verify and Monitor Deployment

Use the following commands to check the status of your deployment and pods:

```bash
# Check the deployment status
kubectl get deployments -n github-runners

# Check the runner pods status
kubectl get pods -n github-runners -o wide

# View logs for a specific pod to debug or monitor startup
kubectl logs <pod-name> -n github-runners
```

### 5. Runner Deregistration (Graceful Shutdown)

The runner container uses a pre-stop hook defined in the deployment manifest. When a pod is terminated (for example, during a scaling event or update), the container will run the deregistration command:

```bash
./config.sh remove --unattended --token ${ACCESS_TOKEN}
```

This step ensures that the runner is cleanly unregistered from GitHub.

## Summary

- **Building & Pushing the Image:** Create the container image with the GitHub runner and push it to your registry.
- **Kubernetes Deployment:** Use the provided deployment and secret manifests to deploy and manage your runners on AKS.
- **Lifecycle Management:** The startup script ensures the runner is configured and running, while the lifecycle hook handles graceful deregistration.

These instructions provide an end-to-end guide for setting up GitHub self-hosted runners in an AKS environment using containerized runners.
